# ReactvsAngular
This report provides comparison between two most popular JavaScript libraries, React and Angular. Both of them are very efficient and being used by many web developers, however it’s hard for new web developers to make a choice between these two technologies. In our project , we use GQM analysis to define a set of metrics to help comparing the two libraries on different aspects. For the final conclusion, the report will not only give a result of which library is better,  but also provide a set of comparison  results of the two libraries on different factors like license, performance, easy to use, etc. To help new developers to have a general understanding of the two libraries. Most of the comparisons available online have a give biased conclusions on one of them. Report results will give a fair and objective comparison for user's’ reference.
